# How to check if a number is Prime

## We are already known that: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 and is divisible by only 1 and itself.

## Some interesting facts about Prime Number:
* 2 is the only even prime number also the smallest prime number.
  ** All of prime number can be represented in form of 6k + 1 or 6k - 1, k is any natural number. 
     But a number can be represented in form of 6k + 1 or 6k - 1, where k is any natural number can not be a prime number yet.
    *** Example: With k = 1, 6.1 + 1 = 7 is a prime number.
                 With k = 20, 6.20 - 1 = 119 is not a prime number because 119 is divisible by 7, 17, 1 and itself.
* 2 and 3 are only two adjacent natural prime number.
  ** Goldbach Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of two primes.
    *** Example: 8 = 5 + 3
                 20 = 13 + 7
* Wilson Theorem: A natural number greater than 1 is a prime number if and only if: (p - 1) ! ≡ -1 mod p OR (p - 1) ! ≡ (p-1) mod p.
    *** Example:
